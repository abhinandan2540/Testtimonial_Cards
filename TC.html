            <p>I find myself recomending roadmap.sh to all <br> the internees or junior developers. it's greate <br> way
                to
                skill up and grow on your career</p>

        <p>roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. i was fortunate to discovered it <br> during my university days back in
            2018. Back then it was a single <br> repository with 3 images. it's amazing to see how much impact it <br>
            has had on
            millions of lives since then</p>
